Are you constantly bickering with your friends about who has the best anime taste? Or perhaps you just want a fun, meme-filled way to gauge your own preferences? Look no further!

üöÄ Features

    Anime Search: Easily find your favorite anime using the integrated search functionality, powered by a local SQLite database and the Jikan API (for extended search results).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    Go: The backend logic, database interaction, and API handling are all powered by Go, known for its performance and concurrency.

    HTMX: This lightweight JavaScript library allows for dynamic HTML updates without writing a lot of custom JavaScript, making the user experience snappy and interactive.

    SQLite: A file-based database used to store anime information locally, ensuring quick access to frequently searched titles.

    Jikan API: When your local database doesn't have the anime you're looking for, the app reaches out to the Jikan API to fetch more data.
